# netlifyrandomword

A small app that generates a random word from the random-words npm along with redirects for API calls to jsonplaceholder.typicode

One can see the basic app [here](https://hellonetlify4166416.netlify.com). At present it is set up to load a random word and random users
on load.

The purpose of this program was to experiment with Netlify and practice building a React app.
